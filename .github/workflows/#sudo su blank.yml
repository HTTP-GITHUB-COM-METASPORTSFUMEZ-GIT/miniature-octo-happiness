code --install-extension GitHub.copilot

Step 2: Sign In to GitHub
After installing the extension, you need to sign in to your GitHub account. You can do this by clicking on the GitHub Copilot icon in the VS Code status bar and following the prompts to authenticate.

Step 3: Enable GitHub Copilot
Once signed in, you can enable GitHub Copilot by adding the following configuration to your settings.json file in VS Code:

JSON

{
  "github.copilot.enable": true
}
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Step 4: Use GitHub Copilot
Now, you can start using GitHub Copilot. Simply start typing in a code file, and Copilot will provide suggestions. You can accept suggestions by pressing Tab.

Step 5: Ensure Continuity
To ensure GitHub Copilot continues to work when you log out and log back in, make sure your authentication token is saved. This is typically handled by VS Code, but you can check your settings to ensure tokens are stored securely.

Example settings.json Configuration
Hereâ€™s an example of what your settings.json might look like:

JSON

{
  "github.copilot.enable": true,
  "github.copilot.advanced": {
    "autoComplete": true,
    "inlineSuggestions": true
  }
}
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Step 6: Push Your Changes
Finally, push your changes to GitHub to ensure everything is saved:

git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Copilot configuration"
git push origin main# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
