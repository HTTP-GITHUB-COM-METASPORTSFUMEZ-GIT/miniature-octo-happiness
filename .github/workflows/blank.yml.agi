git checkout -b AGI

Step 2: Add AGI-Specific Code
Hereâ€™s an example of some AGI-related code you might want to include. This example uses a simple neural network model with TensorFlow:

Install TensorFlow:
pip install tensorflow

Create a Python Script: Create a file named agi_model.py with the following content:
Python

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Define the model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Print the model summary
model.summary()
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Add a README Section for AGI: Update your README.md to include a section about the AGI branch:
## AGI Branch

This branch focuses on developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capabilities. The initial setup includes a simple neural network model using TensorFlow.

Step 3: Push the AGI Branch
Push your changes to GitHub:

git add .
git commit -m "Add AGI branch with initial TensorFlow model"
git push origin AGI# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
