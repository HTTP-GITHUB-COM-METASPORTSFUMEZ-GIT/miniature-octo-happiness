#sudo su 
echo "# douglas-davis-automated-software-production" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/ELONISEVIL/douglas-davis-automated-software-production.git
git push -u origin main 
# douglas-davis-automated-software-production
Automated-Software-Production.

Step 2: Add a README File
Create a README.md file in the root of your repository with the following content:

# Automated Software Production

This project aims to automate the software production process using various tools and technologies.

Step 3: Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a directory named .github/workflows in the root of your repository. Inside this directory, create a file named ci.yml with the following content:

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18.x'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

Step 4: Add a Simple Node.js Project
To complete the setup, you can add a simple Node.js project. Create a package.json file in the root of your repository with the following content:

JSON

{
  "name": "automated-software-production",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A project to automate software production",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

Step 5: Push Your Changes
Finally, push your changes to GitHub:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
